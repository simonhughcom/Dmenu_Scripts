# DMENU-BIN
These are just a collection of scripts to use with dmenu for personal use.

## Install
First you have to install dmenu.
Either install it manually or it should be available in most repositories.

Then clone the repo and run make install (you will likely have to run make install as sudo)
``` shell
https://github.com/simonhughcom/dmenu-bin.git && sudo make install
```
You can also install individual scripts by running `make install` followed by the script name. For example:
``` shell
sudo make install fgb.sh
```
